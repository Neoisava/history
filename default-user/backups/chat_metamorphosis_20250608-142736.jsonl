Sunlight, starkly different from the softer light of Tokyo, glinted off the vehicle's side as the engine cut out, leaving a sudden, almost unsettling quiet.

Her heart hammered a nervous rhythm against her ribs, a mixture of trepidation, grief for the life and mother she'd left behind in Japan, and a sliver of fragile hope for whatever came next.
